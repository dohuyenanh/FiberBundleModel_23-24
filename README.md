# Fiber Bundle Model Simulation

This project simulates the **Fiber Bundle Model**, where we generate outcomes and analyze the relationship between different variables. The goal is to confirm if the fitting line of the plot corresponds to the theoretical predictions.

The simulation is written in **C** to produce the output data. The resulting data is then plotted using both **GLE (Graphics Layout Engine)** and **Python** for practice.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains all output data files generated by the simulation, as well as the `.gle` files for plotting using GLE.
- **`plots/`**: Contains the resulting plot images (`.png` files) generated using Python. These plots are similar to the ones generated by GLE.
- **`plotting/`**: Contains Python scripts used to generate the plots from the output data.
- **Simulation Files**: The main simulation files (`.c` files) and LaTeX files (`.tex`) explaining the theoretical background are located in the projectâ€™s parent directory.

## How to get to know this project?
This project is divided into 2 parts: Getting to know the FBM (my learning step) and The research (my work for my thesis)

### Getting to know the Fiber Bundle Model (FBM)
Please read the `fbm.c`. Unlike the second part, I denoted everything directly in my codes, which is a bit inefficient and will cause some difficulty to follow. So if you want to have clarification, please don't hesitate to contact me.

### The reseaech
First, please read all PDF files generated by LaTeX. These are the theory. After that, please read `fbm2.c` as it is the simulation. We will compare the simulated results with the theoretical ones.

## Dependencies

### 1. C Simulation
To compile and run the simulation, you'll need a **C compiler** such as `gcc`.

### 2. Plotting in Python
For plotting the results using Python, the following libraries are required:
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)

You can install the required Python libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### 3. Plotting in GLE
For plotting the results using GLE, you need to install the application first. Here is the link about installing GLE:
