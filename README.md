# Fiber Bundle Model Simulation

This project simulates the **Fiber Bundle Model (FBM)** to analyze the relationships between various variables in fiber systems. The project is divided into two parts:
- **FBM without Plasticity**: Focuses on deriving relationships between variables through simulation.
- **FBM with Plasticity**: Compares the results from simulation to theoretical predictions to confirm the validity of the theory.

The simulation is implemented in **C** to produce output data, and the results are plotted using both **GLE (Graphics Layout Engine)** and **Python**.

## Note to Readers

This project is currently **in progress**, particularly the **FBM with Plasticity** section. As a result, there may be missing files, incomplete documentations, or incomplete features. The project is expected to be completed by the **end of 2024**.

### Missing Theory Documentation for FBM Without Plasticity

For the **no_plasticity** section, the `theory/` folder is currently **missing**, as all theoretical details are denoted directly within the code files as comments. I acknowledge this might make it more difficult to follow this section, and I plan to add a detailed guide soon to help walk readers through this part.

If you need clarification at any point, please don’t hesitate to contact me for assistance.

Thank you for your understanding, and feel free to reach out with any questions.

### Explanation of Subfolders (`no_plasticity/` and `with_plasticity/`):

**Note**: This is just a more detailed explanation of `file_tree.md`. 

- **theory/**: 
  - In **no_plasticity**, this folder (will) contain documentation of the relations derived from the simulation and how the simulation is developed.
  - In **with_plasticity**, it contains the theoretical formulation to compare against the simulation results.
  
- **simulation/**: Contains the **C files** for the model simulation in the `program/` subfolder. Running these C files generates output data files (`.txt`) in the `data/` folder.

- **data/**: Stores the output data (`.txt` files) generated by the simulation (`.c` from `program/`)

- **plotting/**: Contains **Python scripts** to generate plots from the simulation’s output data. These Python plots are meant for practice and should match the GLE-generated plots. The `.gle` scripts are also in this directory. 

- **plots/**: Stores the resulting plot images (`.png` files) generated by the Python scripts.

## Project Overview

### 1. FBM Without Plasticity

- **Goal**: In this section, the simulation is used to derive relationships between variables. No theoretical model is used for comparison; the goal is purely exploratory. 
- **Theory**: The `theory/` folder contains PDF documentation of the relationships found through the simulation (derived after running the simulation).
- **Simulation**: The `fbm.c` file in the `simulation/program/` folder simulates the system without plasticity.
- **Plotting**: 
  - The simulation generates output data, stored in the `data/` folder.
  - Results can be plotted using either GLE (`.gle` files) or Python (scripts in `plotting/`).
  - Plots are saved in the `plotting/plots/` folder.

### 2. FBM With Plasticity

- **Goal**: In this part, the simulation results are compared with theoretical predictions to confirm the validity of the theory.
- **Theory**: The `theory/` folder contains PDFs generated from LaTeX files, outlining the theoretical relationships between variables.
- **Simulation**: The `fbm.c` file in the `simulation/program/` folder simulates the system with plasticity.
- **Plotting**:
  - Output data is stored in the `data/` folder.
  - You can use GLE to plot the results (via `.gle` files) or Python (`.py` in `plotting/`).
  - The generated plots will be saved in the `plots/` folder. The simulation results are then compared with the theoretical curves to verify the accuracy of the theory.

## Dependencies

### 1. C Simulation

To compile and run the simulation, you will need a **C compiler** like `gcc`. Example command:

```bash
gcc -o fbm fbm.c
./fbm
```
This will generate output data files in the data/ folder.

### 2. Plotting in Python

For plotting results using Python, the following libraries are required:

  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### 3. Plotting in GLE

To plot results using GLE, you will need to install GLE. You can download and install it from the following link:
https://glx.sourceforge.io/tut/gcc.html

Once installed, you can run the .gle files from the `plotting/` folder to generate plots.
